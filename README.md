RealTime_autopanProcessor - final for Audio Programming in C



What have you done with the project so far?

    -I have studied/explored the internet and github forums for good examples of simple synths, any examples of portmidi, and examples of autopan. I don't plan on using any of the code I found because it's too advanced. 
    What I HAVE done is study/modify the mono synth from Week13 and I started crafting an autopan based off of the one on Github.

What have you not done for the project?

    -I have not implented the autopan effect within the mono snyth. I need to figure out how portmidi and your mono synth example work better before I can.

What problems if any, have you encountered?

    -Mostly problems with myself not fully understanding some values and their syntaxes.
    -I'm also wondering if it's possible to adjust the parameters of my autopan processor in real-time? Or do they always have to be predetermined in the code? Is the only way to do this, to create a working UI? 
    -Would help to get a refresher on the 2*PI stuff like:
    // ( Amp = 1.0 + kDepth * sin(2.0 * M_PI * kRate * n / gSampleRate);)

    -Also I couldn't get the monosynth exmaple to compile or run, so hopefully all will be clear by the end of class!

Thanks Akito
